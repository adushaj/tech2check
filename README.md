# Tech2Check
> Information Technology Undergraduate Senior Capstone Project 

Our project model is a web-based rental service based off of the services provided by Oakland University’s Student Technology Center (STC). The STC rents out various technological equipment for students to use – however, it is difficult to monitor the status of these rentals and gather specific information about them with the current system. This web application makes management of rental inventory easier to track.
