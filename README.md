# Tech2Check

Our project model is a web-based rental service based off of the services provided by Oakland University’s Student Technology Center (STC).The STC rents out various technological equipment for students to use – however, it is difficult to monitor the status of these rentals and gather specific information about them with the current system.

Color palette for our site: `FUSCHIA #A239CA` and `STARK #E7DFDD`
